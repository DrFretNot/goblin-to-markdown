## Requirements

## Installation

1. Download the `goblin_markdown_cli.py` script to your computer
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system

## Usage

### Command Line Usage

The command-line tool (`goblin_markdown_cli.py`) provides a simple way to convert your Goblin Tools task lists to Markdown or Obsidian Canvas format.

#### Basic Usage

```bash
python goblin_markdown_cli.py path/to/your/file.goblin
```

This will convert the specified file to Markdown format and save it with the same name but a `.md` extension.

#### Options

- `--timestamps` or `-t`: Include creation timestamps in the output
- `--canvas` or `-c`: Generate an Obsidian Canvas file instead of Markdown

#### Examples

1. Convert a Goblin file to Markdown:

   ```bash
   python goblin_markdown_cli.py magic_todo.goblin
   ```

2. Convert a JSON file to Markdown with timestamps:

   ```bash
   python goblin_markdown_cli.py tasks.json --timestamps
   ```

3. Convert a file to Obsidian Canvas format:

   ```bash
   python goblin_markdown_cli.py magic_todo.goblin --canvas
   ```

### Web Interface Usage

The web interface (`goblin_markdown_web.html`) provides a user-friendly way to convert your files without any installation:

1. Open the web interface in your browser
2. Drag and drop your `.goblin` or `.json` file
3. Select your desired output format (Markdown, Obsidian Canvas, or both)
4. Optionally enable timestamps
5. Click "Convert"
6. Download the converted file(s)

The web interface works entirely in your browser - no files are uploaded to any server.

## Input File Format

Your input file should be exported from Goblin Tools and contain tasks in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "unique_id",
    "text": "Task description",
    "estimate": 3600, // Time estimate in seconds (optional)
    "category": "üõ†", // Emoji category (optional)
    "parentId": null, // null for root tasks, or ID of parent task
    "timestamp": 1234567890, // Creation timestamp (optional)
    "completed": false // Task completion status (optional)
  }
  // ... more tasks
]
```

## Output Format

The script generates a Markdown file with:

- A main "Tasks" heading
- Task hierarchies using proper indentation
- Checkboxes for task completion tracking (checked if completed in the original file)
- Time estimates in human-readable format (e.g., "2h 30m")
- Category emojis for root-level tasks
- Optional timestamps showing when tasks were created

Example output:

```markdown
# Tasks

## üõ† Main Task (2h 30m)

- [ ] Subtask 1 (30m)
- [x] Subtask 2 (2h) (Created: 2023-07-15 14:30)
  - [ ] Sub-subtask A (1h)
  - [ ] Sub-subtask B (1h)
```

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for:

- File not found
- Invalid JSON format
- Unsupported file extensions

## Examples

1. Convert a JSON file exported from Goblin Tools:

   ```bash
   python goblin_markdown_cli.py tasks.json
   ```

2. Convert a Goblin file exported from Goblin Tools:

   ```bash
   python goblin_markdown_cli.py magic_todo.goblin
   ```

3. Process a file in a different directory:

   ```bash
   python goblin_markdown_cli.py "path/to/my tasks.json"
   ```

4. Include timestamps in the output:
   ```bash
   python goblin_markdown_cli.py magic_todo.goblin --timestamps
   ```

## Notes

- The script automatically handles spaces in filenames
- Output files are created in the same directory as the input file
- Time estimates are optional and will be omitted if not provided
- Category emojis are optional and will be omitted if not provided
- Task completion status is preserved from the original file
- Timestamps are displayed in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format
